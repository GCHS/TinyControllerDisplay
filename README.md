# TinyControllerDisplay
Input display for XInput controllers. 

Displays controller input via windows on your desktop. Right-click to choose which controllers to display and whether to move them individually, click-and-drag to move them around. Uncheck all controllers to close the program.


If you would prefer something other than an Xbox One Elite pad, you can use the right click menu to switch between an XB1 Elite pad, a DS4 Revision 2, and a Dualsense pad.
