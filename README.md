# TinyControllerDisplay
Input display for XInput controllers. 

Displays controller input via windows on your desktop. Right-click to choose which controllers to display and whether to move them individually, click-and-drag to move them around. Uncheck all controllers to close the program.

If you would prefer something other than an Xbox One Elite pad, the image assets in the project can be replaced and the program recompiled. However, the trigger arcs will need to be in the same place, and all moving components will still move in the same directions by the same amount.
